A repo for  books!

## Description

Within this applciation,  I  was tasked to refactor old RESTFUL routes to a more modern API using GrpahQL and Apollo Server.

- Depending on the application, using RESTFUL routes may be an option. However, a modern application would be slightly different. It's best to know both ways of routing in REACT.
- This project was an already working site so it was mainly refactoring all the code and adding new dependencies.
- This project brings this website into a new environment.
- I learned the importance of models being the first focus of a server side, then typedefs and then resolvers to tie it all together. After, I move on to the client side using what I gained from GraphQL.


## Usage
Enclosed is a link to the deployed Heroku site.
